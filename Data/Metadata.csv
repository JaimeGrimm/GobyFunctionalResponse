These data were generated in fall 2018 in functional response experiments using round goby as predators and amphipods as prey,
Column,Description
Replicate,Experimental replicate
Density,Initial prey density at the start of the experiment
Treatment,"The experimental treatment. Habitat complexity, where no.str had three plexiglas plates added to the aquarium, low.str had two plexiglas plates with a single layer of pebbles attached and one plate with two layers of pebbles, and high.str had three plates with two layers of pebbles added (see manuscript for complete description of treatments). For substrate-type experiments substrate is either sand or rocks."
